    <p>Craps Portfolio comments</p>
    <p>For my craps game I decided to go with a simple UI interface. Growing up in Vegas I'm extremely familiar with all casino table games (as determined by law.. kidding.. only slightly) so it was really fun to actually work on. CSS and HTML are not my strongest points but I did kind of enjoy writing the javascript to get the game to work.

        I decided on creating three elements. A play button, a clear button and a game display area. A function for rolling dice that contains the variables for and results of a random die roll. That function is used by the playCraps function to simulate a game of craps being played.
        
        The playCraps function takes your first "roll" and gives it to you as your point and updates the play area as to what your point is.  Also checking to see if you've hit a insta-win roll of 7 or 11. If you do it moves to the case letting you know what you've won. Otherwise it moves down the list to try and get to you to roll your point again and if you do it returns you to the win case, however if you do not win (by rolling a 7 before you roll your point) it moves you to the case that politely informs you that you haven't won and ends the game. 
        
        For the life of me I couldn't get the game to rig to the button properly but using the tools I have natively on my comptuer it works fine. I guess that's why I did two projects which brings me to...</p>

    <p>Pizza Time!!!</p>
    <p>Who doesn't love pizza? People on diets and bodybuilders but who cares about them! While its not fancy it's functional and that's what matters the most. I started by adding a title to the header so that for some reason if people didn't know what is was it would be easy to figure out.

        Secondly I decided to go with creating a form to hold all the information for the pizza orders. The first section holds the customers information for the order. The second section uses radio buttons to select a pizza size since checkboxes would allow for some weird combination of ordering a "small-large pizza" and I don't know of any pizza place that would let you do something like that. 
        
        I added checkboxes for pizza toppings because you can have a near infinite number of pizza topping combinations and in order to make sure they would all show on the pizza it's better to use checkboxes than radio buttons like I did with the pizza size. 
        
        The javascript for this is fairly simple (which is why I enjoyed doing it so much) in the submit button you have the variables for the customers information, pizza size and toppings. A for loop to determine what pizza size was selected and if logic to determine what toppings were selected and stores them in the toppings variable.
        
        A little clean up of the order variable to make things be able to display nice and neat inside the order conformation window and viola one simple pizza order wepbage made by a tenaious fledgling web developer who didn't give up!</p>

    <p>I really enjoyed the class and I learned a lot. I will admit that there were times in which I struggled and I didn't feel like I was going to be able to make it but nevertheless I perservered and used all of my resources that were available to me. </p>

Javasript was very hard for me. I had to lean a lot of friends, youtube videos, and stackOverflow to figure out how to get things to work how I wanted them to.
There's just something about having three different areas to have your work in and having them all loosely connected just causes my brain to wrinkle in the bad way.
Overall I enjoyed the class and learning the material. It ended up being a bit more challenging than I thought it would be.

<p>Ultimately I would love to be able to create my own website for my IT consulting business I'd like to create. I'm not really a fan of using templates like a lot of other people. I want to learn the skill of web development so not only can I make my own websites but websites for others who aren't as technologically adept as myself but need that digital footprint to help get the business noticed and off the ground</p>
<p>Right now it doesn't look like much but please keep an eye on this space and watch it change. As I learn I'll be implementing more changes to crystalize knowledge but to play around a bit and have fun</p>
