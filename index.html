Javasript was very hard for me. I had to lean a lot of friends, youtube videos, and stackOverflow to figure out how to get things to work how I wanted them to.
There's just something about having three different areas to have your work in and having them all loosely connected just causes my brain to wrinkle in the bad way.
Overall I enjoyed the class and learning the material. It ended up being a bit more challenging than I thought it would be.

<p>Ultimately I would love to be able to create my own website for my IT consulting business I'd like to create. I'm not really a fan of using templates like a lot of other people. I want to learn the skill of web development so not only can I make my own websites but websites for others who aren't as technologically adept as myself but need that digital footprint to help get the business noticed and off the ground</p>
<p>Right now it doesn't look like much but please keep an eye on this space and watch it change. As I learn I'll be implementing more changes to crystalize knowledge but to play around a bit and have fun</p>
