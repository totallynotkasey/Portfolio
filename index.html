    How to build a website. 
</title>
<body>
<p>1/12/2022</p>
<p>Ultimately I would love to be able to create my own website for my IT consulting business I'd like to create. I'm not really a fan of using templates like a lot of other people. I want to learn the skill of web development so not only can I make my own websites but websites for others who aren't as technologically adept as myself but need that digital footprint to help get the business noticed and off the ground</p>
<p>Right now it doesn't look like much but please keep an eye on this space and watch it change. As I learn I'll be implementing more changes to crystalize knowledge but to play around a bit and have fun</p>
